## Game Overview

**The Feud** is a multiplayer game with three main interfaces:

### 1. Home Page

- Users can **create a new game session** or **join an existing session** using a session ID.
- The home page is the starting point for hosts, team members, and spectators.

### 2. Host Dashboard

- The host can **administer the game** using the dashboard.
- Features include:
  - **Loading questions and answers** from a CSV file or selecting from a built-in library.
  - **Setting the score multiplier** for each round.
  - **Marking answers as correct or incorrect** as teams guess.
  - **Game controls** to start/stop timers, reset rounds, and manage team scores.
- The host dashboard is the control center for running the game and updating the game state in real time.

### 3. Team Display

- Team members can **join a session** using the session ID provided by the host.
- Players can **press buzzers** when the round is open to answer questions.
- The team display updates in real time based on the host's actions, showing current questions, scores, and round status.

### 4. Specator Mode

- People who want to spectate can **join a session** using the session ID provided by the host.
- Spectators see the Team Display without any controls.

This setup allows for interactive, real-time gameplay where the host manages the flow and teams participate live.

## Firebase Setup

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. In Project Settings, generate a service account key and download the JSON file.
3. Set the `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable with the contents of your service account JSON.
   - For local development, you can use a `.env` file:

     FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS='{"type":"service_account",...}'
     ```
4. Make sure Firestore is enabled in your Firebase project.

## Heroku Deployment (Backend)

1. [Sign up for Heroku](https://heroku.com/) and install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
2. Create a new Heroku app:
   ```sh
   heroku create your-app-name
   ```
3. Set your environment variables on Heroku:
   ```sh
   heroku config:set FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS='{"type":"service_account",...}'
   ```
4. Push your backend code to Heroku:
   ```sh
   git push heroku main
   ```
5. Your backend will be deployed and accessible at `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com`.
